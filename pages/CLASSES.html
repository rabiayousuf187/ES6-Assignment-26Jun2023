              names:
              <br>a. Create a class for Person including the constructor for firstname and
              lastname.
              <br>b. Create a variable and assign a value of the new Person object using your
              friend's first and last names.
              <br>c. Now add a second variable with another friend's name using their first name
              and last name.
              <br>d. Output both friends into the console with a greeting of hello.</li>
